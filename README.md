# Tracker

A flexible system designed to track individual usage across third party APIs. This is done by proxying the API call through this system to the third party and then running static or dynamic inspection methods for calculating the cost to charge the user. Each user has their own API key and it's easy to view all spending and usage from `/docs`.

I use the system to track my friend's usage from our hosted AI dashboard. You can see my config at https://github.com/samchouse/tracker/blob/main/tracker.config.ts.
